![Using LFortran LSP](https://lfortran.github.io/lfortran-lsp/videos/using-lfortran-lsp.gif)

Fortran language extension for VSCode that utilizes LFortran as its backend. The
extension communicates with VSCode via [Microsoft's Language Server
Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

## Key Features

1. Code Completion: Code completion recommendations will be given as you type,
   along with previews of each recommendation's definition.
2. Linting: highlights errors and warnings in your LFortran code which helps you
   to identify and correct programming errors.
3. Document Symbol Lookup: You can navigate symbols inside a file with
   `Ctrl + Shift + O`. By typing `:` the symbols are grouped by category. Press
   Up or Down and navigate to the place you want.
4. Go-To Symbol Definition: You may jump to the definition of a symbol by
   highlighting over it and pressing `<F12>` or by right clicking it and
   choosing `"Go to Definition"`.
5. Symbol Occurrence Highlighting: When you navigate over a symbol, all its
   instances will be highlighted in the document.
6. Definition Previews: When you hover over a symbol with your cursor, a preview
   of its definition will appear next to the cursor.
7. Symbol Renaming: You may rename any symbol by navigating over it and pressing
   `<F2>` or by right-clicking it and choosing `"Rename Symbol"`.

## Requirements

### VSCode

The extension has been developed against VSCode version `1.95.3` and tested
against VSCode version `1.95.2`. It may work in earlier versions, but for
maximum compatibility please use VSCode version >= `1.95.2`.

### LFortran

You must have lfortran installed before you can use this extension. For the sake
of documentation completeness, the method of installing lfortran from as a git
repository is included below. For additional methods of installation, please
refer to [the documentation](https://docs.lfortran.org/en/installation/).

#### Installing as a git repository

```bash
# 1. Install Miniforge3 if you have not already:
# ----------------------------------------------
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Complete the installation and set your preferences. Be sure to initialize
# conda before proceding to the next step.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Clone the repository to your workspace:
# ------------------------------------------
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran.git
cd lfortran

# 3. Create a conda environment for lfortran:
# -------------------------------------------
conda create -n lf -c conda-forge \
  llvmdev=11.0.1 \
  bison=3.4 \
  re2c \
  python \
  cmake \
  make \
  toml \
  zstd-static \
  pandoc \
  gcc \
  gxx \
  libcxx \
  rapidjson

# 4. Activate the environment:
# ----------------------------
conda activate lf

# 4. Compile lfortran with support for LSP:
# -----------------------------------------
./build0.sh
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DWITH_LSP=yes \
  -DWITH_JSON=yes \
  -DWITH_LLVM=yes \
  -DWITH_RUNTIME_STACKTRACE=yes \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/inst \
  .
make -j$(nproc)

# 5. Once `make` completes, you will find the `lfortran` binary located relative
# to the project root at `src/bin/lfortran`:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ls -l src/bin/lfortran
#-> -rwxr-xr-x 1 dylon dylon 226502136 Dec  4 22:05 src/bin/lfortran
```

##### Updating lfortran

Updating the lfortran repository is straightforward:

```bash
cd /path/to/lfortran
git pull origin main
./build0.sh
# Note: I prefer to pass `--fresh` to `cmake` to avoid issues with development
# artifacts, but do also note that it rebuilds all of the artifacts so it is
# slower.
cmake --fresh \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DWITH_LSP=yes \
  -DWITH_JSON=yes \
  -DWITH_LLVM=yes \
  -DWITH_RUNTIME_STACKTRACE=yes \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/inst \
  .
make -j$(nproc)
```

![Cloning and Building LFortran LSP](https://lfortran.github.io/lfortran-lsp/videos/cloning-and-building-lfortran-lsp.gif)

Once you have compiled the extension, you may import it into VSCode as follows:
1. Click the `"Extensions"` tab or press `Ctrl + Shift + x`.
2. Near the top-right of the panel that opens, click the horizontal ellipsis
   that has the tooltip text `"Views and More Actions..."`.
3. Click `"Install from VSIX..."`
4. Open the `lfortran-lsp-1.0.0.vsix` package you just created.

### Updating LFortran

To update the LFortran extension, do the following:

```bash
cd /path/to/lfortran-lsp
git pull origin main
npm install
npx vsce package
```

The cleanest way to update it in VSCode is to do the following:
1. Click the `"Extensions"` tab or press `Ctrl + Shift + x`.
2. Find the listing for `lfortran-lsp`.
3. Click the gear icon with the tooltip text `"Manage"`
4. Click `"Uninstall"`.
5. Click `"Restart Extensions"` on the `lfortran-lsp` listing where the gear
   icon used to be.
6. Wait a moment for the extensions to reload.
7. Click the `"Refresh"` button near the top-right of the extensions panel (it
   looks like an arrow that is rotating to the right).
8. Wait a moment for the extensions to reload.
9. Reinstall the .vsix archive as before:
   1. Near the top-right of the extensions panel, click the horizontal ellipsis
      that has the tooltip text `"Views and More Actions..."`.
   2. Click `"Install from VSIX..."`
   3. Open the `lfortran-lsp-1.0.0.vsix` package you just created.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, within the project root, run the following: `npm test`:

![Unit Testing LFortran LSP](https://lfortran.github.io/lfortran-lsp/videos/unit-testing-lfortran-lsp.gif)

The end-to-end integration tests run best on a headless server like `xvfb`.
Otherwise, they will open in a visible instance of VSCode. If the tests are not
run on a headless server, then changing the active window or performing any
action within the VSCode window may cause the tests to fail.

The integration tests require an instance of `lfortran` to be installed in
project root of `lfortran-lsp`. You may either clone your instance of `lfortran`
to the project root or symlink it to the same location. I recommend the symlink
approach.

With `xvfb` installed and your instance of `lfortran` installed to the project
root, run the following command: `xvfb-run npm run integ`:

## Debugging

### Configuring logging

![Configuring Logging](https://lfortran.github.io/lfortran-lsp/videos/configuring-logging-lfortran-lsp.gif)

The first step when debugging is to examine the respective logs. This extension
has solid support for logging at various levels, including inputs and outputs to
functions and benchmarks. What is logged is configurable in the following ways:
1. Log level := Granularity of logs to print. ![Log Level](https://lfortran.github.io/lfortran-lsp/images/log-level-configuration-lfortran-lsp.png)
   - `off` Do not print any logs.
   - `fatal` Only log messages about errors that cannot be recovered from.
   - `error` Log errors that prevent functionality but can be recovered from.
   - `warn` Log errors that can be recovered from with default behavior.
   - `info` Log informational messages that are demonstrate the extension is
     running correctly. These may be helpful to non-developer users.
   - `debug` Log additional information that is useful for debugging, but not to
     the level of recording inputs and outputs of functions.
   - `trace` Highest granularity of logging that includes such things as inputs
     and outputs to functions.
   - `all` Show all the logs. This is currently equivalent to `trace`.
2. Log filter := Regular expression used to narrow which messages are logged. If
   you are not familiar with regular expressions, you may treat the respective
   field as a plain text field, for the most part. There are some symbols that
   hold special significance to regular expressions; be especially mindful of
   periods, asterisks, plus signs, parentheses, brackets, and braces. To learn
   more about regular expressions, I recommend
   [regular-expressions.info](https://www.regular-expressions.info/javascript.html)
   or the
   [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions).
   ![Log Filter](https://lfortran.github.io/lfortran-lsp/images/log-filter-configuration-lfortran-lsp.png)
3. Benchmarking := Logs the number of milliseconds required to complete an
   operation along with some (moving) summary statistics. The summary statistics
   include the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum execution times.
   The moving statistics are computed using
   [Welford's online algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Welford's_online_algorithm).
   ![Benchmarking](https://lfortran.github.io/lfortran-lsp/images/benchmark-configuration-lfortran-lsp.png)
4. Pretty-printing := Whether to indent each array element and object field
   relative to its nested level in a manner that makes them easy to examine and
   understand. This includes the size of each indentation level (the number of
   spaces to add per level of indentation).
